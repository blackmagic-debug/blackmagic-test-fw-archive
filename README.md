This repository contains target test firmware.

This is a collection of small firmware projects used for functional and
regression testing of Black Magic Probe targets.

This means, this firmware snippets are meant to test targets, not hosts or
Black Magic itself.

The goal of these firmware collection is to have examples that the Black Magic
developers as well as our HITL CI test system can use to verify that the
targets we support keep working and the bugs that we fixed don't come back. :)
